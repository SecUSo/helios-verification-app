## Verification App

This project belongs to a collection of prototypes for cast-as-intended verification with the Benaloh Challenge that I used for a user study in my master thesis. The app's purpose is to assist a user in cast-as-intended verification. 
To do so the app needs QR-code from the voting website [Verification Usability Study](https://github.com/SecUSo/helios-usability-study)
Be aware that this software is a prototype for evaluation. Encryption is only simulated and thus we do not recomment to use this interface for serious elections as secrecy can be broken easily.
